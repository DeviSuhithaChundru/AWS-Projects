# 🚀 Deploying a Containerized Web App Using Docker & AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This project showcases how I deployed a simple static website by containerizing it with Docker and hosting it on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk. It’s a great example of modern cloud deployment using minimal infrastructure setup.

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **Docker** – To package the web app into a container
- **Nginx** – To serve the HTML page inside the container
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** – To deploy the container to the cloud
- **IAM, EC2, S3** – Used as part of AWS setup and deployment

## 💡 What I Did

- Created a basic HTML page (`index.html`)
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to run it using the Nginx web server
- Built and tested the Docker image locally
- Zipped the project and uploaded it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Configured roles, storage, monitoring, and deployment policy
- Successfully launched the app with a public URL

## 📁 Project Files

- `Dockerfile` – Nginx setup
- `index.html` – Custom static web page
- `Docker_ElasticBeanstalk_WebApp_Deployment.pdf` – Full step-by-step documentation
- `screenshots/` – Images of deployment and setup

## 🌐 Result

The live site confirms the project was successfully deployed through Elastic Beanstalk.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project helped me understand:
- Real-world Docker image creation
- Cloud deployment using AWS services
- IAM roles, EC2 profiles, and instance metadata
- End-to-end DevOps workflows from local to cloud
